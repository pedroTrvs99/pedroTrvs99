# üõ°Ô∏è My Cybersecurity Portfolio: Junior Security Analyst üõ°Ô∏è

Hi there! I'm Pedro, a passionate and aspiring Junior Security Analyst with a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles, threat detection, incident response, and risk management. I recently completed the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, which provided me with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools and techniques.

This portfolio showcases my practical projects and labs, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world security challenges. My goal is to contribute to a secure digital environment and continually grow my expertise in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
